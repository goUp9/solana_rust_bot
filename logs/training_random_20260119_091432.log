`use_cache=True` is incompatible with gradient checkpointing. Setting `use_cache=False`.
/root/workspace/game_rl_training/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/torch/_dynamo/eval_frame.py:1044: UserWarning: torch.utils.checkpoint: the use_reentrant parameter should be passed explicitly. Starting in PyTorch 2.9, calling checkpoint without use_reentrant will raise an exception. use_reentrant=False is recommended, but if you need to preserve the current default behavior, you can pass use_reentrant=True. Refer to docs for more details on the differences between the two variants.
