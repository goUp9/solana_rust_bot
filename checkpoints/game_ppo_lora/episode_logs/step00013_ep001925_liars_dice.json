All players roll their dice secretly.\n\nGoal: Make bids about total dice across ALL players, or call \"Liar\" on opponent's bid.\n\nActions:\n- Bid (quantity, face): Claim there are at least 'quantity' dice showing 'face' among all dice.\n- Call Liar: Challenge the previous bid.\n\nBidding rules: Each bid must be higher than the previous bid. \"Higher\" means:\n  - Same face value but higher quantity (e.g., \"2 fours\" beats \"1 four\")\n  - Same quantity but higher face value (e.g., \"2 fives\" beats \"2 fours\")\n\nWild dice: 6s are WILD and count as ANY face value.\n- When counting dice for a bid, include 6s in the count\n- Example: Bid \"3 fours\" means at least 3 dice showing EITHER 4 OR 6\n\nWinning: If you call Liar and previous bid was false, opponent loses. If bid was true or exact, you lose.\n\n\n\n# Output Format\nYou must respond with ONLY the action ID (a single number).\nDo NOT include descriptions or explanations.\n\nExamples:\n- For action \"0 -> roll\": respond \"0\"\n- For action \"89 -> a3\": respond \"89\""
